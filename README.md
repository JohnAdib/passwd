### Q&A

#### What is the safest way to keep passwords?
To keep your passwords safe, just write them down on a piece of paper and put it in a safe place like your wallet. You can't hack paper.


#### Is it safe to keep passwords on your phone?
Although it might be tempting and convenient, you should never save passwords on your phone, tablet, or computer. This includes saving them in notes, documents, and even autofill. ... Generally, saving passwords on your devices can create easy access to your accounts if your device were to be stolen or lost.


#### Disadvantages Of Password Managers
Although they greatly ease the user’s burden, password managers pose a risk in that they present a single point of failure. Let’s say an attacker installed a keystroke-logger program on a computer and recorded the user’s master password. The attacker can then access the password manager vault and compromise the user’s accounts on all sites.
